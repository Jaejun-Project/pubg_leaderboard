	- Once register user search player from main page, player's stats will store into database. <br/>
	- Retrieve player info from leaderboard table in Database. <br/>
**Stats**

	- Only register user can search player's stats. <br/>
**Sign up and Login page**
	- People can register and login for the web page.
**Database:**
	a)
		- Use the open API to get the PlayerUnknown's Battleground player stats. 
		- Use MySQL to store the data on who have registered for the website. 
	b)
		- The given API will provide players' stats, play mode, and play seasons. 
		- When audiences sign up for the web page, the sign-up page will require the user name, password, and 				email address And, all of these will be stored in the MySQL database. 
	c)
