# pubg_leaderboard

  
## Final Project Proposal
My website provides the leaderboard for the game called the PlayerUnknown's Battleground. Users of the PlayerUnknown's Battleground can check their ranks and their status on how they have played their game from my website.

## How my site works:
My web page contains below pages.

![Main page](https://github.com/Jaejun-Project/pubg_leaderboard/blob/master/ImgRead/main.png)

**Leaderboards**
- Display all players' rankings with ratings. 
- Once registered user search player from main page, player's stats will store into database.
- Retrieve player info from the leaderboard table in database.

**Database:**

a)

- Use the open API to get the PlayerUnknown's Battleground player stats. 
- Use MySQL to store the data on who have registered for the website. 

b)

- The given API will provide players' stats, play mode, and play seasons. 
- When audiences sign up for the web page, the sign-up page will require the user name, password, and 				email address And, all of these will be stored in the MySQL database. 

c)

- The open API is given by https://pubgtracker.com/site-api.
- Login users' information will be come from the MySQL.
